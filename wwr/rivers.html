            <h2>Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho</h2>
            <p>
                Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon River.
                The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by the people living
                near it because of the number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love with the
                rugged beauty of the river that they never left.
            </p>
            <p>
                Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river and bear and bighorn sheep
                are also commonly sighted. The river corridor is also lined with awe-inspiring ponderosa
                pine which tower over the sandy beaches in the campsites and provide shelter from sun or
                rain when needed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the longest
                undammed rivers in the United States. As a free flowing river the water is higher, faster,
                and colder in the early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer. There are
                good rapids all summer...but families with children who like to swim tend to appreciate the
                late summer's slower, warmer water more.

            <h2>Desolation and Gray Canyon, Utah</h2>
            <p>
                Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere, the
                Green River flows towards the mighty Colorado River and the sea. High grey stone cliffs,
                beautiful desert scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous.
            </p>
            <p>
                This 84-mile trip runs from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River, Utah)
                and boasts outstanding scenery, interesting geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric and
                historic human activity, and great whitewater opportunities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days. Desolation Canyon has been
                recognized as a National Landmark. This designation is based on the uniqueness and rich
                history that the canyon tells.

            <h2>Grand Canyon, Arizona</h2>
            <p>
                This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy of all river trips.
                You will never forget your visit to the Grand Canyon.
            </p>
            <p>
                Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with breathtaking scenery to make
                one truly unforgettable river experience. The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating
                whitewater rapids, but with side canyons and ancient Indian ruins accessible only by river.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>CLASS I - X:</strong> The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The rapids in the Canyon
                are technically rated I - X (1 - 10) to accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river
                variances. However, most people are familiar with the regular I - V river rating scale, so we
                often refer to both.

    <h2>Lochsa River</h2>
    <p>
        The Lochsa River, whose name means "rough water" in Nez Perce, is one of the wildest and most scenic rivers in the Pacific Northwest. Known for its steep gradient and technical rapids, it's a top destination for experienced whitewater rafters seeking a thrilling challenge. Surrounded by the towering trees of the Clearwater National Forest, the Lochsa provides both adrenaline and awe-inspiring beauty.
