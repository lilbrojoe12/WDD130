            My name is Jordan Harris. I am currently working toward a bachelor's degree in Cybersecurity. I like to read and play video games, and I especially enjoy spending time with my wife. I've been married to my wife Elizabeth for a year now, but we don't yet have children.

            I would say there are many advantages to learning web design, especially since it can be helpful to know why a website might not be functioning correctly. I'm taking this course not only because it's required for my degree, but also because I enjoy working with coding and html. I'd like to use what I learn as I put together personal websites and perhaps develop websites in future jobs.

            I've been a member all my life. A quote that I really like is actually from President Gordon B Hinckley in a talk from 2001. He says, "Go forward in life with a twinkle in your eye and a smile on your face, but with great and strong purpose in your heart."
